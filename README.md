# Hi there! I'm Mark Kimmerle

I'm a front-end developer and wannabe designer based in Shelton, CT. I like to build fast, user-friendly websites. Good content, usability, accessibility and performance are some of my favorite things. I have over 25 years of experience in web design and web development, and I also do e-commerce development, logo/print design and e-mail marketing.
